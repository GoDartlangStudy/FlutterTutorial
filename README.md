<h6>생성할 때 프로젝트 이름을 모두 소문자로 해야한다. (Underscore 사용)</h6>

```
-- camelCase 로 생성 시 에러..

use `lowercase_with_underscores` for package names.

Package names should be all lowercase, with underscores to separate words,
`just_like_this`.  Use only basic Latin letters and Arabic digits: [a-z0-9_].
Also, make sure the name is a valid Dart identifier -- that it doesn't start
with digits and isn't a reserved word.
```
